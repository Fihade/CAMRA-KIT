# CAMRA-KIT: A Camera App inspired by Halide's Design

At first, I just want to make a Camera Engine as my Open Source Software. But I decide to code my first iOS/iPad app when I download an app named "Halide Mark II". Now the app capture engine by my SPCameraEngine.

## Overview

The app is a RAW camera means its zoom factor is 1.0. But you can change camera type from wide angle camera to ultra wide camera to get different camera lens if you iPhone has multiple lens.

## Camera Engine
In the project, I make a engine named SPCameraEngine just like a manager to manage current camera extends SPCamera, preview and focus view to promise the capture workflow more influence. So if you have interested in using camera engine to make your camera app, welcome to expand it and commit issues to improve it.
